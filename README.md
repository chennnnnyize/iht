Iterative Hard Thresolding
==========================

This is a translation to Python of the iterative hard thresholding algorithm of
Blumensath & Davies.

Try to find a quick way to solve L1 minimization problem with sparsity.

Description

   Implements the M-sparse algorithm described in [1], [2] and [3].
   This algorithm takes a gradient step and then thresholds to only retain
   M non-zero elements. It allows the step-size to be calculated
   automatically as described in [3] and is therefore now independent from 
   a rescaling of P.
